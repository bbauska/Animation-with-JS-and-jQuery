# Animation-with-JS-and-jQuery
UC Davis' Animation with JavaScript and jQuery.


Hello and welcome to
our first module in our second course in our
JavaScript specialization. In this module, we'll
start working with the jQuery library and
learning about what that library is and how libraries can work
with JavaScript. Then we'll compare the syntax of jQuery to the syntax of
plain vanilla JavaScript. By working with
these two together, you'll learn a lot about both. That's really helpful. Along the way we'll work on
some really great projects. Let's get going and start working with jQuery and JavaScript
in this module.
