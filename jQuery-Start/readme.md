### How to use.  Add the following to your html file utilizing the jquery code.

```
<head>
  <script src="jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

### OR,

```
<head>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head> 
```

### Functions In a Separate File

#### If your website contains a lot of pages, and you want your jQuery functions to be easy to maintain, you can put your jQuery functions in a separate .js file.

#### When we demonstrate jQuery in this tutorial, the functions are added directly into the <head> section. However, sometimes it is preferable to place them in a separate file, like this (use the src attribute to refer to the .js file):

### Example

```
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="my_jquery_functions.js"></script>
</head>
```
